This repository provides a detailed analysis of the 2021/2022 UEFA Champions League (UCL) season, covering key aspects such as attacking and defensive performances, along with other relevant statistics. The analysis is carried out using Python libraries like NumPy for numerical calculations, Seaborn for data visualization, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for plotting and graphing. All analysis is presented through Jupyter Notebooks, which provide an interactive and clear approach to exploring the data. These notebooks demonstrate various data analysis techniques and offer a reproducible workflow for understanding team and player performances throughout the season. By sharing this work, the repository aims to offer valuable insights into the UCL 21/22 season and serve as a resource for anyone interested in sports analytics and data-driven decision-making.
